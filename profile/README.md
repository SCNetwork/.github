<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hi! 
We are a small software developer team from Munich in Germany. We love creating new, innovative and user-focused software solutions. We focus on our customers instead of maximizing profit and love our community. </p>
<h3>Some projects</h3>
Feel free to check out our <a href="https://sc-network.net">website</a> to learn about our current main projects, but here are some that could be interesting for you:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://scnx.xyz">SCNX</a>: Create your very own Discord-Bot and more for your community (only german currently)</li>
    <ul><li>(Some parts (<a href="https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot/issues/13">Learn more</a> of) The code of the CustomBot (the bot you can configure and host for free) can be found here on <a href="https://github.com/SCNetwork/CustomDCBot">GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>The API-Documentation for the SCNX API can also be found here on <a href="https://github.com/SCNetwork/scnx-api">GitHub</a> (currently private as we are working on it)</li>
</ul>
<li>Currently we are not able to publish more of our projects - but we'd love to - as we can't finance the infrastructural costs of our services right now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Development-Team</h3>
We also have btw a team of awesome helpers who help our users setting up and using our services, check them out <a href="https://sc-network.net/about#team">here</a>.

Currently, our official Dev-Team only consists of me, <a href="https://github.com/scderox">@SCDerox</a>, hii  ðŸ‘‹\
Just some short words about me: I am a student from germany who runs this company as a side business and loses money on it, but I really enjoy doing stuff like this and working on new things ^^

<h3>Support us</h3>
